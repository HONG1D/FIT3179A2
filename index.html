                        From <b>2017 to 2019</b>, Malaysia’s domestic tourism expanded steadily. This reflects a healthy economy and growing interest in local travel.
                        However, between <b>2020 and 2021</b>, the pandemic caused a sharp collapse. Visitor numbers fell by about 73%. Total expenditure dropped by 82%. Average spending per trip declined by 18%.
                        In <b>2022 and 2023</b>, the sector began to recover. Although visitor numbers and total expenditure have yet to reach pre-pandemic peaks.
                        Malaysians are spending more per trip suggesting a shift toward higher-value leisure experiences.

                       Kuala Lumpur and Selangor consistently record the darkest marks on the heatmap. This reflects that they are Malaysia’s primary urban and economic hubs.
                       In contrast, Labuan, Perlis, and Putrajaya attract the fewest visitors. This might due to limited tourism infrastructure.
