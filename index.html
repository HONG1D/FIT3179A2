        <h1 class="page-title">Malaysia Domestic Tourism Analysis (2017 - 2023)</h1>
        <p class="page-subtitle">
          Malaysia, a multicultural nation rich in heritage and natural. It remains one of Southeast Asia’s most popular travel destinations.<br>
          This visualization explores Malaysia’s domestic tourism trends through three key perspectives. The National Domestic Tourism Trend <br>
          section highlights yearly changes in total visitors and average expenditure per trip. The State Performance Matrix compares visitor's <br>
          growth rate across states by years. Lastly, the State Economic Overview visualizes tourism receipts and visitor distribution across states.<br>
          Together, these charts provide a comprehensive view of how tourism activity and performance vary across time and regions in Malaysia.
